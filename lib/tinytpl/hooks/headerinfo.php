 * headerinfo shows how to enable hooks (observer pattern) with the
 * tinytpl singleton object.
 *
 * It pushes a system info into the http stream about the tinytpl
 * version in the form "X-Powered-By: tinytpl vX.X.X"
 * This effectively masks any given php version information which possibly
 * might have leaked into a security flaw otherwise.
