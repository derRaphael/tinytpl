<h2>Runtime variables</h2>
<p>tinyTpl knows several variables at runtime, which might come in handy.</p>
<p>
    All these variables are properties of the tiny singleton and can be accessed object wise.
    Either as written here from within a template or by using the full qualified name of the singleton
    from everywhere else.
</p>
<p>
    (array) <code>$this->args</code> contains a list of arguments derived from path info.
    <pre>
    <code>
    /some/path/to/virtual/location</code>
    </pre> 
    will be translated as 
    <pre>
    <code>
    $this->args = array(
        0 => "some",
        1 => "path",
        2 => "to",
        3 => "virtual",
        4 => "location"
    );
    </code>
    </pre>
</p>
<p>(bool) <code>$this->isAjax</code> determines if a request has been made through ajax calls or not.</p>
<p>(string) <code>$this->action</code> contains the name if the current executed base template (outmost).</p>
<p>(string) <code>$this->base</code> contains a full path to the tinyTpl base which includes all other folders.</p>
<p>(string) <code>$this->template_dir</code> contains a full path to the templates.</p>
<p>(string) <code>$this->method</code> contains either "<code>GET</code>" or "<code>POST</code>".</p>
<p>(string) <code>$this->MASTER_TEMPLATE</code> when set to <code>null</code> it will avoid rendering the master template,
otherwise it contains the given master template or overrides with a new one.</p>
<p>(array) <code>$this->template_trigger_collection</code> contains an assoc array with keys as triggers and values as templates.</p>
<p>In global namespace the variable <code>$tiny</code> is registered which is a shorthand for <code>\lib\tinyTpl\tiny::sys()</code>.</p>
<p>Due to the fashion how tiny gains speed, all loaded templates are executed in the context of the main tiny object, this
    allows to acces virtually any of tiny's properties from within the templates.</p>
